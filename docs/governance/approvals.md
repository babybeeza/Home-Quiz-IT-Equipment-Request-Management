# Human approval gates

ทุก phase ใช้สถานะ Draft → In review → Changes requested หรือ Approved งานเปลี่ยน phase ได้เมื่อคนที่รับผิดชอบอนุมัติ artifact revision ที่ตรวจแล้ว AI สร้างหลักฐานและช่วย review ได้ แต่ไม่เป็นผู้อนุมัติงานของตนเอง

| Gate | Required approver | Artifact | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements | Product owner | requirements, scope, acceptance criteria, assumptions | Approved |
| Design | Technical owner | architecture, ADRs, contract, data/test plan | In review for TASK-010 ADR-005 amendment; earlier approvals retained |
| Implement | Code reviewer | code diff, implementation tests and task evidence | In review for TASK-010; approved through TASK-009 |
| Verify | QA / acceptance owner | traceability, functional/reliability/performance evidence | In review for TASK-010 revision; approved through TASK-009 |
| Delivery | Release owner | release revision, runbook, rollback and limitations | Pending |

New revision awaits review; this entry is not an approval |

หากแก้ artifact ที่ approved แล้วอย่างมีนัยสำคัญ ให้เปลี่ยน gate นั้นกลับเป็น In review และบันทึก approval ใหม่พร้อม revision/date ผู้อนุมัติคนเดียวรับหลายบทบาทได้ใน take-home project แต่ต้องระบุบทบาททุกครั้ง

Delivery review on 2026-09-25 found that the recorded Verify approval did not include an AT-33 P1 result or an explicit owner decision for its known list-row deviation. The historical approval entry above remains unchanged; [TASK-012 audit](../quality/evidence/TASK-012-delivery-audit.md) records the mismatch. TASK-010 implements the source criterion, subject to new Design/Implement/Verify review. Delivery remains Pending until the release owner reviews that result, H-1 handling and the final revision.

H-1 disposition, 2026-09-26: the source-storage owner (user) confirmed that the saved assignment download token is revoked. A subsequent workspace request to the saved link returned HTTP 403; [TASK-011 evidence](../quality/evidence/TASK-011.md) contains status-only observations. The original URL text remains in published Git history. This owner statement resolves the source-side status question but is not a Design, Implement, Verify or Delivery approval. The release owner still assesses the residual history and final candidate.
